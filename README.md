# Book List
Book List is a web app that allows the user to add a list of books. The books will have the book name, price, category, and description. The user will also be able to delete any book they have added as well as update any information should they wish to. The book list will be stored in the user's local storage so that the list will persist even when the user refreshes the page and/or leaves the site and returns.
